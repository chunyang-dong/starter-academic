title: Imaging serotonin dynamics with designed genetically encoded indicators
abstract: |-
  The neurotransmitter serotonin is involved
  in numerous biological and cognitive
  processes in both health and disease. A
  deeper understanding of serotoninergic
  circuitry and signaling, and the function of
  drugs such as SSRIs, is hindered by the
  inability to readily and reliably measure
  serotonin dynamics with high spatial and
  temporal resolution. We exploited two
  scaffolds to engineer different
  genetically-encoded, single-wavelength
  intensiometric fluorescent sensors for
  serotonin from circularly permuted GFP with
  a bacterial periplasmic binding protein
  (PBP) or serotonin receptor. However, there
  is no known PBP that binds serotonin. To
  produce the PBP-based sensor
  (i5HTSnFR), we developed a machine
  learning-guided binding pocket redesign
  strategy and applied it to an acetylcholine
  sensor scaffold. To produce the serotonin
  receptor-based sensor (sLight), we applied
  the module strategy used in designing our
  published dopamine sensor dLight. We
  characterized and validated both sensors’
  performance, whereby we can detect
  serotonin transients in mammalian cells,
  dissociated neuronal cultures, acute slices
  and freely behaving mice.
