title: A photoconvertible genetically encoded glutamate indicator for neuronal imaging
abstract: Synaptic transmission is a critical event of information processing in
  the brain. In particular, the specific patterns of neural activity at
  individual synapses can drive the growth, stabilization and elimination of
  synaptic connections. However, how complex patterns of neural activity at
  multiple synapses interact to drive changes in circuit connectivity remains
  poorly defined. Recently, improved genetically-encoded indicators of neuronal
  activity have allowed for functional measurements through optical recordings
  of calcium, glutamate and voltage. These applications have significantly
  advanced the field of systems neuroscience by permitting optical recordings in
  specific subpopulations of neurons; however, they donâ€™t provide information to
  link the activity to the structural changes. Here we developed a new class of
  photo-convertible genetically encoded glutamate indicator that would enable
  one to specifically record glutamate activity in subcellular compartments,
  such as single spines and axonal termini within the densely labeled neurons.
  We demonstrate the utility of this new glutamate indicator in cells and rat
  hippocampal neurons. We expect that our design strategy can be applied to
  other types of neurotransmitter indicators in the pipeline to allow multiplex
  imaging of synapses.
