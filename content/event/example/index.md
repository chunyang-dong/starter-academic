abstract: Calcium imaging and channelrhodopsin-assisted electrophysiological
  methods have greatly advanced understanding of the neuronal activity patterns
  of genetically-defined neurons during motivated behavior. However, the
  cell-type specific neurochemical mechanisms that underlie neuronal activity
  patterns during motivated behavior are unclear. Recently, several
  neurotransmitter-specific sensors have been engineered with cell-type specific
  precision. In addition, the recently-engineered DART technology allows for
  cell-type specific pharmacological manipulation. This panel will present the
  latest neurotechnology to detect and manipulate specific neurotransmitters as
  well as present new research on their use during motivated behaviors. Jason
  Dong, a graduate student in Dr. Lin Tianâ€™ s lab will describe the engineering
  and use of serotonin sensors during motivated behavior and to enable real-time
  pharmacology for psychedelic discovery. Dr. Jonathan Marvin, Senior Scientist
  at Janelia Farms, will discuss the protein engineering and development of
  sensors for glutamate, GABA, ATP, and acetylcholine. Dillon McGovern, graduate
  student in the Root lab, will present his research recording glutamate and
  GABA binding on ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons that identifies novel
  neurochemical mechanisms underlying how these specific neurons signal reward,
  aversion, and learned predictors of these outcomes. Finally, Dr. Michael
  Tadross will discuss the engineering and use of DART in multiple cell-type
  specific populations to regulate behavior under motivated and pathological
  conditions. Together, this session will demonstrate the utility of a
  fast-growing toolbox of sensors for chemical transmission that is well poised
  to permit direct functional analysis of how the spatiotemporal coding of
  chemical input signaling mediates the plasticity and function of brain
  circuits.
