title: Genetically-encoded glutamate sensors for monitoring large populations of
  individual synapses in vivo
abstract: "Recently developed genetically-encoded sensors have allowed for
  functional measurements of glutamate in specific subpopulations of neurons;
  however, the rapid kinetics of glutamate transients make it difficult to
  monitor large populations of individual synapses in deep brain regions with
  laser-scanning microscopy. The overarching goal of our BRAIN initiative
  project is to develop glutamate sensors that will enable large-scale
  monitoring of the activity of individual synapses in vivo. Ultimately, our
  novel sensors will enhance our understanding of how neural activity at
  individual synapses and their neighbors can influence long-term stability of
  neural circuit connections. We have two specific goals: (1) to develop
  glutamate sensors and highlighters with slower kinetics, (2) to develop
  glutamate integrators that transform transient synaptic responses into
  permanent labels of active synapses. To accomplish our goals, we have
  developed a novel class of photoactivatable and photoconvertible genetically
  encoded glutamate sensors based on cpmEos. The first iteration of sensor
  engineering led to the development of prototype glutamate sensors which
  displayed slower off kinetics and increased brightness in purified protein and
  mammalian HEK293T cells. However, these lacked robust membrane expression in
  dissociated neuronal cultures and rodent brain slices. Using high-throughput
  screening of targeted libraries to optimize the expression patterns and
  structural analysis to optimize folding stability, we have made tremendous
  improvements. Furthermore, we have generated lead candidates in adeno
  associated virus in which we have tested the expression, sensitivity, kinetics
  and ultimately their ability to monitor synaptic activity in rodent brain
  slices and in vivo."
