abstract: Serotonin plays a central role in cognition and is the target of most
  pharmaceuticals for psychiatric disorders. Existing drugs have limited
  efficacy; creation of improved versions will require better understanding of
  sero- tonergic circuitry, which has been hampered by our inability to monitor
  serotonin release and transport with high spatial and temporal resolution. We
  developed and applied a binding-pocket redesign strategy, guided by machine
  learning, to create a high-performance, soluble, fluorescent serotonin sensor
  (iSeroSnFR), enabling optical detection of millisecond-scale serotonin
  transients. We demonstrate that iSeroSnFR can be used to detect serotonin
  release in freely behaving mice during fear conditioning, social interaction,
  and sleep/wake transitions. We also developed a robust assay of serotonin
  transporter function and modu- lation by drugs. We expect that both
  machine-learning-guided binding-pocket redesign and iSeroSnFR will have broad
  utility for the development of other sensors and in vitro and in vivo
  serotonin detection, respectively.
