abstract: Genetically encoded dopamine sensors based on green fluorescent
  protein (GFP) enable high-resolution imaging of dopamine dynamics in behaving
  animals. However, these GFP-based variants cannot be readily combined with
  commonly used optical sensors and actuators, due to spectral overlap. We
  therefore engineered red-shifted variants of dopamine sensors called RdLight1,
  based on mApple. RdLight1 can be combined with GFP-based sensors with minimal
  interference and shows high photostability, permitting prolonged continuous
  imaging. We demonstrate the utility of RdLight1 for receptor-specific
  pharmacological analysis in cell culture, simultaneous assessment of dopamine
  release and cell-type-specific neuronal activity and simultaneous subsecond
  monitoring of multiple neurotransmitters in freely behaving rats. Dual color
  photometry revealed that dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens evoked by
  reward predictive cues is accompanied by a rapid suppression of glutamate
  release. By enabling multiplexed imaging of dopamine with other circuit
  components in vivo, RdLight1 opens avenues or understanding many aspects of
  dopamine biology.
